# coding-exercise

This project contains test files for the following exercises

## Test 1:
Assert that the dynamic text (the lorem ipsum text block) on the page contains a word at least 10 characters in length.

### Stretch goal:
Print the longest word on the page.


## Test 2:
Assert that the "Punisher" image (silhouette with a skull on his chest) does not appear on the page.  This test may pass or fail on any given execution depending on whether the punisher happens to be on the page.

### Stretch goal:
Give names to each avatar that can appear on the page and print out each avatars name.

## How to run tests
Tests can be executed using `pytest` either using command line or an IDE like PyCharm
